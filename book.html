          In april or may 2022:<br>
	  i joined commerce villa for only studying🙂<br>
	  "as time passed by"
	  i made new friend named aarush🤗<br>
	  "as more time passed"<br>
	  around june or july 2022:<br>
	  aarush introduced me to someone😊💝(you)<br>
	  "me who didn't know where it was gonna take me😇"<br>
	  we started normal chatting at tuition🙃<br>
	  we became good friends🙃<br>	
        </p>

        <p>
          Soon I started to wait for her arrival🙄<Br>
	  Soon my eyes started to search for her🙄🙄<Br>
	  Soon I started to look for moments where <br>
	  I would get to talk to her😊<br>
	  Soon I started to take up upcoming <br>
	  opprrtunities to be with her😊<br>
	  "just like this time went by"  
        </p>
        <p>
          I was very happy and😋<Br> 
	  wanted things to just continue like this😎<br>
	  But in my heart somewhere<br>
	  A question arised if I was being an annoyance to her?😥<br>
	  I started to care about her feelings and<br>
	  I started to push myself away from her a little,😫<br>
	  just because i thought i was being a creep, 😫<br>
	  for continuously talking to her and about her with aarush<Br>
        </p>        
      </div>
      <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 5)">
        <p>
	  The one thing which i liked a lot<br>
	  were our eye contacts<bR>
	  usually i am very afraid to make eye contacts<br>
	  but she is 😍i don't know special?😀<br>
	  because i remeber each and every eye contact😀<br>
	  and i every day longed for the moment to make it🙃<Br>
	</p>
	<p>
	  "as time passed by"<br>
	  the end for class 11th came near and,😣<br>
	  me who thought of confessing let it go without it,😥<br>
	  during the holiday period, i had only one thought,😔<br>
	  (will she be there for class 12th too or not😔)<br>
	  but my father😖 struck me with lightning😖<br>
	  he told me not to attend tuition anymore<Br>
	  that would mean no meet with her?<br>
	  i first time argued😤 and my father accepted😤<Br>
          
        </p>
        <p>
	  april or may 2023:<br>
	  i came a bit early to meet up whith you know who😇<br>
	  but as usual she came late😵<br>
	  which became a good thing for me in future🙃<Br>
	  and I was at my peak happiness to see her🙃<Br>
        </p>
        <p>
	  june 2023:<br>
	  i am unable to understand😕<br>
	  why the fuck has she started sitting in front rows?😕	<br>
	  that means no talks only sights of the angel?😔<br>
	  i started to worry but nothing happened😥<br>
	  "a lot of time passed" 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 6)">
        <p>
	  august or september 2023:<Br>
	  she usually came late and jaanvi sat in front rows<br>
	  tried to reserve seat for her<Br>
	  but there were many others😏 who wanted that seat<br>
	  as a result the seat got taken<br>
	  srishti with no other choice had to come at back😲<br>
	  where everyday i tried my best to reserve a seat for her😤<br>
	  without telling it to anyone😤<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          again we were able to talk, meet and chat😌<br>
	  to MY heart's extent<br>
	  this continued till one day something huge happened😮<br>
        </p>
	<p>
	  a fight between hiya and jaanvi😯<br>
	  for the reserved seat in the front😯<Br>
	  i enjoyed the fight but didn't thought,<br>
	  of the consequence🤔 of it at that time🤔<br>
	  Yes, Jaanvi stopped the seat reservation,😐<br>
	  as a result Srishti had not other choice but<br>
	  look for an empty seat<br>
	  and me being me i everyday reserved a seat🤗<br>
	  offcourse without anyone knowing🤗<br>
	  but there were only few days in which she came😑<Br>
	</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this,7)">
        <p>
	  "the time passed a lot quickly,<br>
	  as time passes fast when we are enjoying"<br>
	  feburary or march:<br>
	  the main event came during this period😑<br>
	  which caused a lot of damage😑<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	  but before that the commercvilla test series came😶<br>
	  which during which there was a break of 1 hour🤔<br>
	  that one hour was very special<br>
	  1st day of test aarush,me,you,jaanvi all together🙂<br>
	  chatted and talked which was a lot of fun😍<br>
	  and i thought to this after i came home<br>
	  ki for next 13 days i would be able to talk,<br>
	  regularly with her for 1 full hour😙<br>
	  the thought made me happy but it didn't last for long😫<Br>
	</p>
	<p>
	  i still remember the day, date and time😫<br>
	  when it happened a certain call came😕<Br>
	  which broke literally everything😔<br>
	  before it everything was going smoothly😔<br>
	  but that one call ruined everything😔<br>
	  i still dispise it and will never,<br>
	  ever forget it😖<br>
	</p>      
      </div>
      <div class="page" onclick="movePage(this,8)">
        <p>
	  anyways It's your birthday😇<br>
	  and not ruining it😇<br>
	  I want to whple heartedly say😌<br>
	  <h2>A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY🎉🎂🎀💗🥳</h2><br>
	  Even if i'm not with you at this special day😥<br>
	  Even if i was not destined to be there😥<br>
	  You will always be near me🙂<br>
	  You will always have a special place in my heart💝<br>
	</p>

      <div class="page" onclick="movePage(this,10)">
	<p>
	  i don't know if u are reading this bcz i made it to open on double tap<Br>
	  but if u are i m happy<Br>
	</p>
	<p>
	  listen it's just my own theory <br>
	  i think i kinda know why you thought that aarush had a crush on u and not me<br>
	  its bcz a person who never wants to be in a relation with a certain person never thinks that he/she has a crush on him/her.<br>
	  so accordingly even if I would have confessed before i don't think u would have accepted and it's all cool<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	  anyways i wrote something during my fake depression phase to cheer myself up<BR>
	  (it might sound a bit offensive)<br>
	  it goes like<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	  kuch bate dil mein toh thi par kabhi zuban par nahi ayi<br>
	  pta mujhe badme lga ki woh kabhi zuban par ana hi nahi chahti thi<br>
	  kyu tum iss kadar meri zindagi mein ayi<br>
	  ki tum meri zindagi mein aa kar kabhi muskurana hi nahi chahti thi<br>
